  <h1>NFL Championship Era</h1>
  <p></p>

  <p><strong>The Origins of Professional Football in Washington, D.C.</strong></p>
  <p>Washington's NFL franchise has taken on many different looks throughout the years, but the first iteration was the Washington Redskins.</p> 
<p> George Preston Marshall originally owned the professional team in Boston, but relocated to Washington, D.C. in 1937, thus birthing the Washington Redskins.</p>

<p>1937 also marked the debut of franchise legend Sammy Baugh. "Slinging Sammy" quarterbacked the Redskins to an NFL Championship in their first year of existence.</p>

  <p>Baugh captained Washington to four more NFL Chamionship appearances in the next eight years, including a second title in 1942, all en route to a Hall of Fame career.</p>

  <p>Over the next few decades, Washington was mostly stuck in mediocrity ... until the franchise was revitalized by Vince Lombardi during the dawn of the Super Bowl Era.</p>
