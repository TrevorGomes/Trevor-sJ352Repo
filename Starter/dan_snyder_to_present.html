  <h1>Dan Snyder Era to Present Era</h1>
  <p></p>

  <p><strong>The Lowest of the Lows for Professional Football in D.C. ... but with a Ray of Hope for the Future</strong></p>
  <p>Dan Snyder owned the team for 24 years, yet his tenure featured only six playoff appearances, five winning seasons, and <em>two</em> playoff wins.</p>

<p>Washington had a carousel of coaches and quarterbacks during the Snyder Era, marking an era of instability and dwelling in the basement of the NFC East.</p>
<p>Despite Snyder's incompetency, there were some bright spots in the franchise that unforunately did not pan out due to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
  <p>The first was All-Pro safety Sean Taylor, who the Redskins drafted fifth overall from the University of Miami.</p>
  <p><img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/1200/675/Sean-Taylor.jpg?ve=1&tl=1" alt="Sean Taylor" title="Sean Taylor" width=550px height=300px></p>
  <p>Taylor made the NFL's All-Pro Second Team at the young age of 24, and flashed the potential to become one of the great safeties in league history.</p>
  <p>His potential would sadly never be realized, however, as Taylor was fatally shot during a home invasion in Miami.</p>
  <p>The murder of Taylor remains one of the greatest tragedies in franchise history, and continues to be one of the NFL's most discussed "what if?" stories.</p>
  <p>Another sign of hope for the Redskins was Robert Griffin III. Washington drafted the Heisman Trophy winner second overall in the 2012 Draft.</p>

  <p> In 2012, Griffin propelled the Redskins to a top-five scoring offense and their most exciting season in years. Griffin was named AP Offensive Rookie of the Year and Washington finished 10-6.</p>
  <P>The Redskins hosted the Seahawks in the Wild Card round in front of a crowd of over 84,000 at FedEx Field. Wahington jumped out to a 14-0 lead, then disaster struck.</P>

  <p>After Washington surrendered 21 unasnwered points, Griffin, playing through a knee injury, chased down a bad snap. Griffin then fell to the ground clutching his knee and couldn't get back up.</p>
  <p>The young franchise quarterback was diagnosed with a torn ACL, LCL, and meniscus in his right knee, permanently derailing his career.</p>
  <p>Washington hasn't reached those offensive heights or double-digit wins in a season since, progressing through numerous starting quarterbacks and head coaches.</p>
  <p>In 2020, following years of controversy surrounding the term "Redskins", the franchise temporarily changed its name to the "Washington Football Team".</p>

  <p>After two years of searching for a permanent name change, the franchise decided on "Washington Commanders", to recognize the military ties of the city of Washington, D.C.</p>

  <p>The rebrand received mixed reviews and the verdict is still out on whether the fanbase generally likes or dislikes the new identity (it seems to be leaning more towards dislike).</p>
  <p>In 2023, the fanbase received the best news they'd heard in years: Dan Snyder was discussing selling the team.</p>
  <p>Snyder began negotiations in April and the deal to sell the franchise to a group led by Josh Harris was unananimously approved by NFL owners on July 20, 2023.</p>

  <p>After a disappointing 2023 season, the Commanders had the most active offseason of any team, hiring new head coach Dan Quinn and starting fresh with a new coaching staff, drafting potential franchise cornerstone Jayden Daniels second overall, and overhauling the roster.</p>
  <p>In only a year's time, Josh Harris gave fans more to believe in than Snyder had in years.</p>
  <p>Under Harris' ownership, one of the most passionate fanbases in the NFL now has hope that the franchise will return professional football in Washington, D.C. to its former glory.</p>
