  <h1>The Super Bowl Era</h1>
  <p></p>

  <p><strong>The Golden Era of Professional Football in Washington, D.C.</strong></p>
  <p>The first Super Bowl took place in 1966, ushering in the finest era in Washington Redskins franchise history.</p>
    <p>The turnaround for football in D.C. began in 1969, when legendary head coach Vince Lombardi led Washington to their first winning season in 15 years.</p>

<p>Though Lombardi would only coach in Washington for one season before tragically dying of colon cancer at the age of 57, his impact on the franchise was indelible.</p>
<p>Lombardi would eventually be inducted into Washington's Ring of Fame for his contributions. The shift in the franchise's culture caused by Lombardi led to much success in the 1970s under head coach George Allen.</p>

<p>The Redskins saw their most success since the 1940s with Allen at the helm, appearing in the playoffs five times and the Super Bowl once.</p> 
<p>Washington fell to the undefeated Dolphins in 1972, a team many laud as the greatest ever, but it wouldn't be long until the franchise would claim its first Super Bowl title.</p>
<p>In 1981, the greatest coach in franchise history was hired: Joe Gibbs.</p>

<p>Gibbs led Washington to its finest era, recording eight playoff appearances, four Super Bowl appearances, and three Super Bowl Titles in 1982, 1987, and 1991.</p>
<p>Perhaps Gibbs' most impressive feat was leading the Redskins to three Super Bowls with three different starting quarterbacks, something no other coach has done and possibly ever will do.</p>

<p>After winning Super Bowl XXII in 1987, Doug Williams (pictured above in the middle) became the first Black starting quarterback in NFL history to claim a Super Bowl title.</p>
<p>This marked a significant shift in the popular perception of Black quarterbacks and what they were capable of, blazing a trail for many contemporary signal callers.</p>
<p>After Gibbs parted ways with the franchise in 1992, Washington fell back into obscurity.</p>
<p>In 1997, The Redskins relocated from their long-time home Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium (colloquially known as "RFK") in Washington, D.C. to Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in Landover, Maryland.</p>

<p>Jack Kent Cooke Stadium would eventually be renamed FedEx Field in 1999, when Daniel Snyder purchased the team from former owner Jack Kent Cooke's estate.</p>
<p>Snyder's tenure saw the franchise plunge into mismanagement and scandal, transforming a once prestigious NFL franchise into a laughing stock of the league and one of the poorest-run franchises in sports history.</p>

<p>This brings us to the Washington Redskins' dreadfully abysmal 21st century.</p>
