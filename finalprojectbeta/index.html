                <p>Hall of Fame center Shaquille O’Neal blames Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver cites the World Series and the election. These are just two of the many theories floated to explain why NBA viewership is down to start the 2024 season.
                  <br>
                  As of Nov. 21, through the first 18 games broadcasted on the network, NBA games on ESPN are averaging 1.772 million viewers, a 28% decline from the 2023 season, according to <a href="https://frontofficesports.com/reader-mailbag-why-are-nba-ratings-down-to-start-the-season/" target="_blank">Front Office Sports.</a>
                  <br>
                  TNT viewership was also down by 3% prior to the first highly-anticipated matchup between the Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers, two of the Eastern Conference’s top teams.
                  <br>
                  O’Neal’s gripes with widespread three-point shooting suggests a more long-term issue and is echoed by many, especially older fans who have witnessed the analytical approach to basketball sweep through the association.
                  <br>
                  Those accustomed to the slow pace and high volume of mid-range shots liken the modern style of play to an All-Star Game featuring little defense and an absurd number of threes.
                  <br>
                  Unfortunately for fans, the trend shows no signs of slowing down. Since Curry and the Warriors proved that predicating an offense around shooting threes is not only viable, but optimal, the three-point shot has dominated the league.
                  <br>
                  This coincided with statistics-driven front offices rising to prominence in all sports, expanding analytics departments to crunch numbers and determine the most efficient form of basketball.
                  <br>
                  As the NBA quickly discovered, three is, in fact, more than two.
                  <br>
                  All 30 teams flocked to this playstyle and centers who never dreamed of stepping foot on the perimeter were quickly practicing their jump shots.
                  <br>
                  A numbers-based approach is great for organizations that want to compete, but not so great for maintaining a diversity of playstyles. This is one of the primary complaints of those who blame three-pointers for the decline in viewership, such as O’Neal.
                  <br>
                  Teams lack identity and largely play the same brand of basketball, creating a monotonous on-court product that is simply unappealing to many.

                <h3>Other Explanations</h3>
                <p>Others point to the oversaturation and devaluation of the regular season to explain why viewers aren’t tuning in as frequently. With 82 games, each match has much lower stakes and feels like less of a spectacle than NFL games, for example. 
                  <br>
                  Recent postseason performances from low-seeded teams, such as the Miami Heat making a Finals appearance as the eighth seed in 2023 or the Lakers reaching the Western Conference Finals as the seventh seed in the same year, have thrown the importance of the regular season into question.
                  <br>
                  Though the most glaring issue with a devalued regular season is the incentive for teams to allow stars to “load manage.” Load management is a practice of resting a player, typically a star, in hopes of preserving their health for the playoffs.
                  <br>
                  The idea of load management would puzzle stars of the past, but is ubiquitous in today’s game.
                  <br>
                As found in the NBA’s study on load management and shared in an article on NBA.com, the average number of games missed per season by “star players” has markedly risen. In the ‘90s, stars missed an average of 10.6 games a year. In the 2020s, that number is up to 23.9 games.
